# Flippy the Dolphin — working notes for Claude

A 2-of-2 agent wallet: an AI agent proposes a transaction, a human physically approves it on a
Flipper Zero, and only then does it execute. ETHOnline 2026, testnet only, three people, one week.

Read `docs/SPEC.md` before making design decisions. `docs/DECISIONS.md` lists what is already
settled — do not reopen those without being asked.

## Layout

- `apps/hub` — Next.js 15 App Router + tRPC v11 + Drizzle (T3). API only: agent loop,
  proposal store, relayer, the iOS and bridge surfaces.
- `apps/bridge` — Node process on the laptop with the Flipper. USB serial, holds the human key in v1.
- `packages/protocol` — shared types, the EIP-712 digest, `HumanSigner`, `MockHumanSigner`.
- `packages/contracts` — Foundry. `FlippyGate` is the 2-of-2 gate.
- `device/flippy-js` — the Flipper app, written in mJS.

## Rules specific to this repo

- **Never edit `packages/protocol/vectors/execute.json`.** It is the frozen proof that Solidity and
  TypeScript produce the same EIP-712 digest, asserted by `test/Digest.t.sol` and `digest.test.ts`.
  If it changes, every signature breaks and the symptom is an unhelpful "bad signature".
- **Never copy an ABI or a shared type.** Import from `@flippy/contracts` / `@flippy/protocol`.
- **Anything reaching the chain or the device goes through `HumanSigner`.** That interface is why
  two thirds of the team can work without hardware. Do not add a code path that bypasses it.
- **Proposal status changes go through the state machine** (`ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` in protocol).
  An illegal transition should throw, not warn.
- The Flipper JS engine has **no crypto, no bigint, no USB, no exceptions, and no closures**. It
  is mJS, not JavaScript. Do not suggest signing there.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm contracts:test                    # forge test, 13 tests incl. the digest vector
pnpm --filter @flippy/protocol test    # vitest
pnpm typecheck
pnpm dev                               # turbo, all apps
```

If `forge` is not found, Foundry is at `~/.foundry/bin` or `~/.config/.foundry/bin` (when
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set). `./scripts/setup.sh` locates it; do not hardcode either path.

## Style

- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. The existing code is the reference for density.
- Errors should be loud. A missing signer, a mismatched digest or an illegal state transition
  should stop the process, not degrade quietly — a silent failure on stage is unrecoverable.
- Testnet keys are checked in on purpose. Do not treat them as secrets, and do not add real ones.

## When writing Anthropic API code

Use the `claude-api` skill. Model ids and the thinking/effort parameters have changed recently
and guessing them wastes time. Default model here is `claude-opus-5`.
